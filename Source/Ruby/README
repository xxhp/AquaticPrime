	Original implementation by John Labovitz
	Updated and gemmed by Benjamin Rister
	http://github.com/bdrister/AquaticPrime


== DESCRIPTION:

AquaticPrime is a cryptographically secure licensing method for shareware applications. The Ruby implementation currently only generates licenses, and is intended for use in online stores.

See http://github.com/bdrister/AquaticPrime for information about the overall design and usage of AquaticPrime.


== INSTALL:

For a freestanding install:
	gem install aquaticprime
	
If using Bundler (e.g. Rails 3), add this to your Gemfile…
	gem 'aquaticprime'
…then run "bundle install".


== EXAMPLE:

	require 'aquaticprime'
	
	publicKey  = '0xE9D8BF...' # from AquaticPrime Developer License Utility
	privateKey = '0x9BE7F9...' # from AquaticPrime Developer License Utility
	aquatic_prime = AquaticPrime.new(publicKey, privateKey)
	puts aquatic_prime.license_data('name' => 'User Name', 'email' => 'User Email')
